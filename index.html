    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/Me.jpg" alt="Rachel Iaconianni" height="150" width="150">
    <p>I am currently attending a coding bootcamp at Rutgers University. Recently, I started a new position at the FAA
        Tech Center as a Configuration Management Specialist. Before I started working for the FAA Tech Center, I was a
        Personal Banker for a small bank called Univest. I was in the banking industry for 7 years. Also, I am currently
        a board member for Big Brothers Big Sisters of Atlantic and Cape May county.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include volunteering, playing with my cats, learning new things, watching different streaming
        services, and playing video games when I have the time. My cats are named Pennywise Dreadful and Violet
        Manhands. I call them Penny and Violet for short. They are both rescues, and they are the cutest little
        fluffballs. Before I started my coding bootcamp, I was taking American Sign Language classes. Currently, my
        favorite show is on Hulu, and it's called Castle Rock.</p>
