            <p>I am currently attending a coding bootcamp at Rutgers University. Recently, I started a new position at
                the
                FAA
                Tech Center as a Configuration Management Specialist. Before I started working for the FAA Tech Center,
                I
                was a
                Personal Banker for a small bank called Univest. I was in the banking industry for 7 years. Also, I am
                currently
                a board member for Big Brothers Big Sisters of Atlantic and Cape May Counties.</p>
            <p>My hobbies include volunteering, playing with my cats, learning new things, watching different streaming
                services, and playing video games when I have the time. My cats are named Pennywise Dreadful and Violet
                Manhands. I call them Penny and Violet for short. They are both rescues, and they are the cutest little
                fluffballs. Before I started my coding bootcamp, I was taking American Sign Language classes. Currently,
                my
                favorite show is on Hulu, and it's called Castle Rock.</p>
